⚙️ BACKEND FLOW (Behind the Scenes)
Phase 1: Task Intake
User clicks "Start Task"
    ↓
Frontend → POST /api/tasks
    ↓
Backend receives: { description: "...", workflow_type: "..." }
    ↓
Generate unique task_id (UUID)
    ↓
Store in database: status = "pending"
    ↓
Return task_id to frontend immediately
Key Point: User gets instant response, actual work happens async

Phase 2: Task Decomposition
Task Decomposer analyzes the task
    ↓
Looks at workflow_type: "research_write_review"
    ↓
Creates 3 subtasks:
  1. [Research Agent] "Research information about X"
     Dependencies: none
     
  2. [Writer Agent] "Write content based on research"
     Dependencies: subtask #1
     
  3. [Reviewer Agent] "Review and improve content"
     Dependencies: subtask #2
    ↓
Each subtask stored in database with:
  - subtask_id
  - assigned agent name
  - dependencies list
  - status = "pending"
Key Point: Dependencies create execution order (DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph)

Phase 3: Execution Planning
Execution Engine builds dependency graph:

  [Research] ──→ [Writer] ──→ [Reviewer]
  (no deps)      (needs 1)    (needs 2)
    ↓
Creates "ready queue" with tasks that have no pending dependencies
    ↓
Initially: ready_queue = [Research Agent]
(Writer & Reviewer must wait)
Key Point: Enables parallel execution when multiple tasks have no dependencies

Phase 4: Agent Execution (The Core Magic)
For Each Subtask:
1. Pick from ready_queue
2. Get the assigned agent
3. Prepare ExecutionContext:
   - subtask_id
   - input_data (results from dependency subtasks)
   - shared_context (original task description)
   - timeout settings
4. Call agent.execute(context)
What Happens Inside Agent:
Research Agent gets called:
    ↓
Reads: context.shared_context["description"]
    ↓
Simulates work (in production: call real APIs, search engines, databases)
    ↓
Takes 2 seconds
    ↓
Returns: AgentResult {
    success: true,
    data: {
        sources: [...],
        summary: "...",
        key_points: [...]
    }
}
    ↓
Backend stores this output in database
    ↓
Update subtask status = "completed"
Concurrent Execution:
If execution graph looks like:

     [Fetch Data]
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┐
   ↓         ↓
[Analyze A] [Analyze B]  ← These run in PARALLEL
   ↓         ↓
   └────┬────┘
        ↓
    [Combine]

Backend uses asyncio.gather() to run A & B simultaneously
Phase 5: Communication Between Agents
Writer Agent starts:
    ↓
Looks at: context.input_data
    ↓
Finds: research_subtask_output = { sources: [...], summary: "..." }
    ↓
Uses this data to write content
    ↓
Doesn't need to "call" Research Agent
    ↓
Data flows through execution context
Key Point: Agents never directly call each other - data passed through orchestrator

Phase 6: Retry & Error Handling
If agent.execute() fails:
    ↓
Retry attempt #1 (wait 2 seconds)
    ↓
Still fails?
    ↓
Retry attempt #2 (wait 4 seconds - exponential backoff)
    ↓
Still fails?
    ↓
Retry attempt #3 (wait 8 seconds)
    ↓
All retries exhausted:
    - Mark subtask as "failed"
    - Store error message
    - Continue with other subtasks if possible
    - Mark parent task as "failed"
Key Point: System is resilient - one failure doesn't crash everything

Phase 7: Real-time Updates (WebSocket)
Every time something changes:
    ↓
Backend emits event:
{
    type: "subtask_started",
    task_id: "...",
    subtask_id: "...",
    timestamp: "..."
}
    ↓
WebSocket broadcasts to all connected clients
    ↓
Frontend receives immediately
    ↓
Updates UI in real-time (progress bars, status badges)
Events Emitted:

task_started
subtask_started
subtask_completed (with progress %)
subtask_failed
task_completed (with final_output)
task_failed
Phase 8: Result Aggregation
All subtasks complete:
    ↓
Execution Engine calls _aggregate_results()
    ↓
Combines all subtask outputs:
{
    summary: "Task completed",
    results: {
        "subtask-0": { research data },
        "subtask-1": { written content },
        "subtask-2": { reviewed content }
    },
    final_content: "..." ← Last subtask's main output
}
    ↓
Store in database: task.final_output
    ↓
Update: task.status = "completed", progress = 100%
    ↓
Emit: "task_completed" event via WebSocket
    ↓
Frontend shows results page
🔄 COMPLETE END-TO-END FLOW EXAMPLE
User Task: "Write a blog post about electric vehicles"
FRONTEND:
User types → Selects workflow → Clicks Start
    ↓
BACKEND:
Creates task_id: abc-123
Creates 3 subtasks:
  - abc-123-0: Research Agent
  - abc-123-1: Writer Agent  
  - abc-123-2: Reviewer Agent
    ↓
FRONTEND:
WebSocket connects to ws://api/tasks/abc-123
Shows: "Task started, 0% complete"
    ↓
BACKEND:
Starts Research Agent (no dependencies)
Updates: subtask-0 status = "running"
    ↓
FRONTEND (WebSocket receives):
"Research Agent started..."
Progress bar: 0% → 10%
    ↓
BACKEND:
Research Agent completes (2 sec)
Stores output in context
Updates: subtask-0 status = "completed"
Calculates: progress = 33%
Adds Writer Agent to ready_queue
    ↓
FRONTEND (WebSocket receives):
"✓ Research Agent completed"
Progress bar: 33%
Writer Agent status changes: gray → yellow (running)
    ↓
BACKEND:
Starts Writer Agent
Passes research output as input
Writer takes 3 seconds
    ↓

🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS
Frontend is Reactive:
Submits task immediately
Connects WebSocket for updates
UI updates automatically as backend progresses
No polling needed
Backend is Orchestrator:
Breaks complex → simple
Manages dependencies
Runs agents in optimal order
Handles failures gracefully
Streams progress in real-time
Agents are Workers:
Isolated, focused responsibilities
Receive context, return results
Don't know about each other
Can run in parallel when possible
Data Flows Forward Only:
Task → Subtasks → Agents → Results → Aggregation → User
No circular dependencies, clean data flow!
